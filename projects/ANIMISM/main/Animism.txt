Animism
The Living City
Final Project Alongside Arch. Nitsan Bartov
Tutor: Arch. Moti Bodek, 5th Year

As we enter the 21st century, humanity’s striving for stability is being replaced by a constant desire for change and stimulation.

The built environment ironically reflects the gap between these desires, and is increasingly becoming more rigid and lifeless, a salient example of which is Netanya’s Ir Yamim district. This project presents a new way of reading space through people; The city lives, adapts, and reacts to an ever-changing reality. It is dynamic and relevant, encouraging a sense of empathy between the city and its people.

<strong>ANIMISM<strong> is the birth of the living city.
